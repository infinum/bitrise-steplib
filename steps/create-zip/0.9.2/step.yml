  path, provide the directory you want to compress.          \n2. In the **Target
  directory path** input, you can select where to output the compressed file. \n\n###
  Troubleshooting\n\nIf the **Source directory** path does not exist, there will be
  an error.\nIf the folder structure belonging to the destination does not exist,
  you will be notified with a warning in the log and then the Step will create it.\nIf
  a ZIP exists on the specified destination, the user will be notified with a warning
  in the log and then the previous file will be overwritten.\n\n### Related Steps\n\n
