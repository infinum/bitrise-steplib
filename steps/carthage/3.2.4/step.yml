  Downloads and builds the dependencies your Cocoa application needs.

  ### Configuring the Step
  1. Add the **Carthage** Step in your Workflow.
  2. Select `bootstrap` Carthage command in the **Carthage command to run** input. Make sure you have the **Bitrise.io Cache:Pull** Step before and the **Bitrise.io Cache:Push** Step after the **Carthage** Step in your Workflow to cache files and speed up your Bitrise build.
  2. Provide your GitHub credentials in the **GitHub Personal Access Token** input to avoid GitHub rate limit issues. Don't worry, your credentials are safe with us since we store them encrypted and do not print them out in build logs.
  3. Optionally, you can provide any extra flag for the Carthage command you wish to run in the **Additional options for Carthage command** input.
  5. To get more information printed out, set the **Enable verbose logging** to `yes`.

  ### Troubleshooting
  It is important that you use `bootstrap` Carthage command, as this is the only command that can leverage the cache! If you run, for example, the `update` command, it won't generate the required cache information, because the `update` command will disregard the available files or the cache.
