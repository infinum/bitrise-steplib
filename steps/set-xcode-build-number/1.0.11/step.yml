title: Set Xcode Project Build Number
summary: Set the value of your iOS app's bundle version in the `Info.plist` file to
  the specified version number.
description: "Set the value of your iOS app's bundle version in the `Info.plist` file
  to the specified version number. A great\nway to keep track of versions when submitting
  bug reports.\n\nIf your IPA contains multiple build targets, they need to have the
  same version number as your app's main target has.\nIn that case, you need to add
  this Step to your Workflow for each build target: if you have, say, three targets,
  you need to have three instances of this Step in your Workflow.\nIf there are targets
  with different version numbers the app cannot be submitted for App Review or Beta
  App Review.\n\n### Configuring the Step \n\n1. Set the file path to the `Info.plist`
  file in the `Info.plist` file path input.\n1. Add a value in the Build Number input.
  \n   This sets the CFBundleVersion key to the specified value in the `Info.plist`
  file. The default value is the `$BITRISE_BUILD_NUMBER` Environment Variable.\n1.
  Optionally, add a value in the Version Number input. This will set the `CFBundleShortVersionString`
  key to the specified value in the `Info.plist` file. This input is not required.\n\n###
