title: Cordova Prepare
summary: Runs Cordova Prepare for your project
description: "Prepares your Cordova project. \n\nThe Step prepares your Cordova project
  by calling `cordova prepare` and copying files into platform(s), making the project
  ready to be built.\n\n### Configuring the Step\n\n1. Make sure the selected platform
  (iOS, Android, or both) matches your project in the **Platform to use in cordova-cli
  commands** Step input.\n2. The **Cordova version** input can be used to install
  a specific version of Cordova. By default the pre-installed version will be used
  which can differ from stack to stack. Check the current stack images [here](https://github.com/bitrise-io/bitrise.io/tree/master/system_reports).\n3.
  For the **Working directory** input, make sure you have your `config.xml` file at
  the root of your repository, or in case it's located elsewhere, make sure this input
  points to that directory.\n4. Caching can be enabled for `node_modules` provided
  you have the [Cache Pull](https://www.bitrise.io/integrations/steps/cache-pull)
  and [Cache Push](https://www.bitrise.io/integrations/steps/cache-push) Steps set
  up.  \n\n### Troubleshooting\n\nMake sure your platforms are added to your `config.xml`
  & `package.json` before running `cordova prepare` as that is a prerequisite of running
  this command.\n\n### Useful links\n\n- [Cordova CLI Reference](https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/latest/reference/cordova-cli/)\n\n###
