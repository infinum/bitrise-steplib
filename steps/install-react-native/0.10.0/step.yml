title: Install React Native
summary: Installs the React Native CLI tools.
description: "The Step installs the React Native command line tools with npm. \nIt
  exposes the `react-native` binary, so you can call `yarn react-native` or `npx react-native`
  directly from your project.\n  \n### Configuring the Step\n\nYou can set which version
  of the CLI you want to use, and add any additional options to the `npm install`
  command.\n\n1. In the **Version of the `@react-native-community/cli` package to
  install**, set the version you need.\n  \n   For example, set it to `0.9.1`. If
  you leave the input empty, the Step will use the latest version.\n   \n2. In the
  **Additional options when installing React Native CLI with `npm install`** input,
  set any additional flags you want to use with the `npm-install` command.\n\n   The
  default is set to `global`. You can use multiple options, separated by a space.
