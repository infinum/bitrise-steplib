      Installation bundle URL. If specified, Flutter will be installed from here and git repository version is ignored.

      For a channel other than stable (e.g. beta), it is recommended to use this input. It is faster than cloning from git.

      Official list of Flutter installation bundles: [https://flutter.dev/docs/development/tools/sdk/releases](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/tools/sdk/releases)

      The URL is expected to begin with: `https://storage.googleapis.com/flutter_infra`

      Example value (beta channel, version 1.6.3, macOS): `https://storage.googleapis.com/flutter_infra/releases/beta/macos/flutter_macos_v1.6.3-beta.zip`
    is_required: false
    summary: Install from bundle. Prefer this input (for other than stable channel),
